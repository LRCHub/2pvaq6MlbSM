[00:14.35] Sometimes, you look the same
[00:19.05] Just like you did before the accident
[00:27.55] When you're staring into space
[00:32.27] It's hard to believe you don't remember it
[00:36.28] Woke up in the ambulance
[00:39.45] You pieced it all together on the drive
[00:58.95] 
[00:45.97] I know you don't remember calling me
[00:52.87] But I told you, even then you looked so pretty
[00:59.98] In a hospital bed
[01:03.53] I remember you said you were scared
[01:10.33] And so was I
[01:16.33] 
[01:16.08] In a stand-still on The Five, thought it was unusually early traffic
[01:24.96] Usually, I don't panic, I just wanted to be on time
[01:33.82] When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder, I didn't even think of pulling over
[01:41.27] I pieced it all together late that night
[02:01.27] 
[01:47.52] And I know you don't remember calling me
[01:54.26] But I told you, even then you looked so pretty
[02:01.10] In a hospital bed
[02:04.67] I remember you said you were scared
[02:11.23] And so was I
[02:17.23] 
[02:14.86] What if it happened to you on a different day?
[02:18.46] On a bridge, where there wasn't a rail in the way?
[02:21.81] Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?
[02:25.29] Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?
[02:28.53] What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car
[02:31.72] What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
[02:35.07] If you changed anything, would you not have survived?
[02:38.32] You're alive, you're alive, you're alive
[02:58.32] 
[02:45.83] And I know you don't remember calling me
[02:53.74] But I told you, even then you looked so pretty
[03:02.33] In your hospital bed
[03:06.39] I remember you said you were scared
[03:23.89] 
[03:18.59] And so am I
